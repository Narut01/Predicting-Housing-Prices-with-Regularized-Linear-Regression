# Predicting Housing Prices with Regularized Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict housing prices using regularized linear regression techniques, specifically Ridge and Lasso regression. By leveraging these techniques, we aim to create a robust model that minimizes overfitting and provides accurate predictions. The project focuses on identifying significant variables that influence housing prices and determining the optimal values of lambda for both Ridge and Lasso regression.

## Problem Statement
A real estate company is looking to expand its operations into a new housing market. The companyâ€™s strategy involves using data-driven insights to identify undervalued properties, purchase them, and sell them at a profit. To support this strategy, they have gathered a dataset of house sales in the target market.

The task is to develop a predictive model using regularized linear regression to estimate the true market value of houses. This model will help the company in making informed decisions about which properties to invest in.

The objectives are to:
1. Identify the most significant variables that affect house prices.
2. Assess how well these variables predict house prices.
3. Determine the optimal lambda values for Ridge and Lasso regression to improve the model's accuracy and robustness.

## Business Goal
The goal is to create a predictive model that accurately reflects the relationship between house prices and various influencing factors. This model will help the real estate company understand the key determinants of house prices in the new market and refine their investment strategy accordingly. By targeting the most influential factors, the company aims to maximize its return on investment and make data-driven decisions in a new market.

## Dataset
Dataset are uploaded.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Collection:** Gather the dataset from house sales.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize/standardize numerical features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand the distribution and relationship between variables.
4. **Model Building:** Implement Ridge and Lasso regression models.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Determine the optimal value of lambda for both Ridge and Lasso regression.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
7. **Conclusion:** Interpret the results and identify significant variables.
